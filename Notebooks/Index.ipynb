    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "Credit card fraud is a growing problem in the financial sector, driven by the increasing volume of digital and online transactions. Fraudulent activities result in significant financial losses for banks and credit card issuers, damage customer trust, and increase operational costs related to fraud investigation and chargebacks. As transaction volumes continue to rise, manual fraud detection methods become inefficient, slow, and prone to human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning provides an opportunity to automatically identify suspicious transaction patterns and flag potentially fraudulent transactions in real time. By leveraging historical transaction data, financial institutions can build predictive models that help distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on applying classification techniques to a real-world credit card transaction dataset to address this challenge."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Financial institutions struggle to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions due to the high volume of daily transactions and the fact that fraud cases are rare compared to legitimate ones. Failing to detect fraud leads to direct financial losses, while incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions inconveniences customers and reduces trust.\n",

    "\n",
    "How can a machine learning classification model be used to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false alarms on legitimate transactions?"

    "- To train and evaluate multiple classification models and compare their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",
